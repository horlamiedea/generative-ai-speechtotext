Healthcare Translation Web App
Overview
The Healthcare Translation Web App is a web-based prototype designed to enable real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. It converts spoken input into text, provides a live transcript, and offers a translated version with audio playback. The app leverages generative AI (OpenAI API) for translations and the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis, ensuring accuracy, especially for medical terminology. This project uses a Django backend, React frontend (with Vite), and Docker for containerization.

Backend (Django): Handles API requests, stores transcripts in PostgreSQL, and integrates with OpenAI for translations. Uses REST framework for API endpoints and Gunicorn for production-like serving.

Frontend (React): Built with Vite, provides a mobile-first UI for speech input, language selection, and text display/audio playback. Uses inline CSS and JavaScript for styling and animations.

Docker: Containerizes both backend and frontend, with docker-compose.yml managing services, including a PostgreSQL database.

AI Tools
OpenAI API: Used in the backend (translation/utils.py) for translating text (e.g., from English to French) using the gpt-3.5-turbo model. The API key is stored securely in backend/.env and accessed via os.getenv. It enhances translation accuracy, especially for medical terminology, by providing a prompt with context (e.g., "You are a professional translator specializing in medical terminology").

Web Speech API: Integrated in the frontend (SpeechInput.jsx) for speech-to-text (via SpeechRecognition) and text-to-speech (via SpeechSynthesis) functionalities. This browser-native API handles real-time voice input and audio playback without external AI services, though it’s limited to supported languages and browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge).

Security Considerations
API Keys: The OpenAI API key is stored in backend/.env and loaded using python-dotenv. The .env file is excluded from version control via .gitignore to prevent exposure. Ensure .env is not shared publicly or committed to repositories.

Data Privacy: The app handles patient-related speech input, so data should be encrypted in transit (using HTTPS in production) and at rest (e.g., PostgreSQL with SSL). Currently, the app uses basic CORS settings (CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True in settings.py for development), but in production, restrict CORS to trusted origins.

Authentication/Authorization: The prototype lacks user authentication, but for a healthcare app, implement OAuth, JWT, or Django’s built-in auth system to secure API endpoints and ensure only authorized users access the translation service.

Input Validation: The backend (views.py) validates incoming text and language parameters, but add sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Use Django’s form validation or serializers for stricter input checks.

Network Security: In Docker, ensure containers are isolated (using Docker networks) and ports are exposed only as needed (e.g., 8000 for backend, 5173 for frontend). Use Docker Compose’s depends_on and named volumes to secure data access.

Error Handling: The app logs errors (e.g., in SpeechInput.jsx and views.py), but implement structured logging (e.g., with logging in Python or a service like Sentry) for production to monitor and mitigate security issues.

Compliance: For healthcare applications, consider compliance with regulations like HIPAA (U.S.) or GDPR (EU) for patient data. Implement encryption, anonymization, and audit logging for sensitive data.

User Guide
Healthcare Translation Web App User Guide
This guide helps users navigate and utilize the features of the Healthcare Translation Web App, designed for real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers.
1. Getting Started
Access the App: Open the app in a web browser at http://localhost:5173/ (or the deployed URL, e.g., on Vercel). Ensure you have a modern browser like Chrome or Edge, as the app uses the Web Speech API for voice input and playback.

Prerequisites: A microphone and speakers are required for speech input and audio playback. Ensure your browser has permission to access these devices.

2. Main Features
Voice-to-Text Transcription:
Click the "Start Speaking" button (with a microphone icon) to begin recording your voice.

A pop-up will appear, stating, “This recording will last for 30 seconds. Continue?” Click “Yes” to proceed or “No” to cancel.

Speak clearly for up to 30 seconds. The app transcribes your speech into text, prioritizing accuracy for medical terms.

Real-Time Translation:
After recording, the app displays the original transcript and automatically translates it into the selected target language (e.g., from English to French).

The translation uses AI-powered processing via OpenAI, ensuring high accuracy for healthcare-related terms.

Audio Playback:
For the translated text, click the “Speak” button next to the translated text to hear the translation played back as audio, aiding communication with non-English-speaking patients or providers.

Language Selection:
Use the “Source Language” dropdown to select the language you’re speaking (e.g., English).

Use the “Target Language” dropdown to choose the language for translation (e.g., French). The app supports over 30 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, and more.

3. Using the App
Launch the App:
Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser. You’ll see the app title, language selectors, recording button, and transcript displays.

Select Languages:
Choose your source language (e.g., English) and target language (e.g., French) from the dropdown menus. This ensures accurate transcription and translation.

Record Speech:
Click “Start Speaking” (with the mic icon) to initiate recording. Confirm the 30-second pop-up by clicking “Yes.”

Speak clearly into your microphone. The app will record for 30 seconds, then transcribe your speech into text.

View Transcripts:
After recording, the “Original” section displays your transcribed speech, and the “Translated” section shows the real-time translation.

The text persists on the screen until you record a new message.

Play Translated Audio:
If a translation is available, click the “Speak” button next to the translated text to hear it played back.

Handle Errors:
If the app encounters a speech recognition error (e.g., no speech detected), an error message appears briefly. Ensure you’re speaking clearly and the microphone is enabled.

If translation fails, an error message will appear, indicating a connection or API issue. Contact support or check your internet connection.

4. Troubleshooting
Microphone Not Working: Ensure your browser has microphone permissions. Check browser settings or refresh the page to grant access.

Recording Too Short: If recording stops before 30 seconds, verify no browser or OS restrictions are limiting microphone access. Check the console for Web Speech API errors.

Translation Not Appearing: Ensure the backend is running (http://localhost:8000) and the frontend is configured to connect to http://backend:8000/api/translate/. Check your internet connection and OpenAI API key.

Audio Playback Not Working: Confirm your browser supports SpeechSynthesis (works best in Chrome/Edge). If issues persist, try a different browser or device.

5. Best Practices
Speak clearly and at a normal pace for accurate transcription, especially for medical terms.

Choose languages supported by both the Web Speech API and OpenAI for optimal results.

For healthcare use, ensure patient consent and data privacy, as the app handles sensitive information.

6. Contact Support
For technical issues, check the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect) and Docker logs (docker-compose logs). Report bugs or request features via your development team or platform support.
